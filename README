CliMax version 1.0
=======================

NAME:

Maximal Clique Computation Tool


DESCRIPTION:


Given an adjacency list the program computes all maximal cliques in a 
given graph (set of graphs)


SYNOPSIS:
    
      
    #include<vector>
    
    #include<Graph.hpp>
    #include<Clique.hpp>
    
    
/* Constructor */
 
/*NOTE:  parent -> vector<int|long|double>, child -> vector<int|long|double> */  

    CliMax<int|long|double> clique(parent, child, 3);  
  



/* Compute Maximal Cliques */  
      clique.ComputeMaxCliques();
      



/* Get Maximal cliques */
      vector<vector<int|long|double>> mc = clique.GetMaxCliques();
      /*  mc contains vector of vertices of a given maximal clique */







CONSTRUCTION AND RUNTIME COMPLEXITY:


     Worst case for n = |V| (number of vertices):
    
     O(3^(n/3))
